# National Anthem ESP32 Project ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
This is an ESP32-based project that displays the national anthem of India on a 16x2 LCD screen using I2C communication. The anthem is shown in a scrolling manner, making it easy to view on limited character screens.

# Project Overview
This project uses the following components:

# ESP32 microcontroller
16x2 LCD Display with I2C interface
Arduino IDE
The code displays the national anthem of India in English transliteration. The text scrolls across the display continuously to accommodate the entire anthem on the small screen.

# Features
Scrolling Text: The text scrolls smoothly across the LCD display.
I2C Communication: The project uses the I2C protocol to communicate with the LCD, saving GPIO pins on the ESP32.
Customizable Delay: The scroll speed can be adjusted easily by modifying the scrollDelay variable.
Getting Started
# Prerequisites
Arduino IDE
LiquidCrystal I2C Library: Install it via the Arduino Library Manager:
Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...
Search for "LiquidCrystal I2C" and install it.
Circuit Diagram
Connect your components as follows:

SDA (I2C Data) to GPIO 21 (ESP32)
SCL (I2C Clock) to GPIO 22 (ESP32)
VCC to 3.3V or 5V (depending on your LCD module)
GND to Ground
# Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NationalAnthemESP32.git
Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Upload the code to your ESP32 board.
# How It Works
The program initializes the LCD and then starts displaying the anthem text in a scrolling manner.
The loop continuously updates the display with the next 16 characters until the entire anthem has been shown.
Usage
Power on the ESP32.
The LCD will first display a greeting ("National Anthem of India") and then start scrolling the anthem text.
Adjust the scroll speed by changing the value of the scrollDelay variable.
# Future Improvements
Implementing support for multiple languages.
Adding a start button to control when the scrolling begins.
